# zani.wtf

This is my personal website.

By default all builds are in unofficial mode, meaning API will always direct to `api.zani.wtf` instead of `localhost:3001` in dev mode.

## Building

Build an optimized production build via

```shell
npm run build
```

## Running

### Prod
```shell
npm run start
```

### Dev
```shell
npm run dev
```
